# Quick Tips

- **Noise is your enemy**: Always be mindful of noise in low-light situations. Reducing ISO or using noise reduction software can help mitigate this issue.

## Bad Light

  - Light bouncing from objects is what the camera captures, and it can be tricky in bad lighting conditions.
  - There are three main ways to improve exposure in low-light:
    - **More light into the sensor**: This can be done by slowing down the shutter speed.
      - Use a tripod for stability, especially when capturing static subjects.
      - Use the timer function to prevent camera shake when pressing the shutter.
      - Any movement, either by the photographer or the subject, will result in blur.
    - **Wider apertures**: Open up your aperture to allow more light in (e.g., from f/5.6 to f/2.8).
      - Be aware that this will affect your depth of field, creating a shallow focus.
      - You can use focus stacking in post-processing to keep more of the image sharp.
    - **Light your subject**: Bringing external light sources (flash, reflectors, or portable lighting) can greatly improve photo quality in bad lighting conditions.
