A friend once told me, "photography is objective," and he wasn’t wrong. Investing in a "professional" camera can be a costly adventure. As the joke goes:

The type of photography you pursue plays a big role in deciding what camera and lenses are right for you. For anyone just starting, I’d recommend the **Sony A6700**. It strikes a nice balance—offering some guidance for beginners without the complexity or bulk of higher-end models.

Here’s a quick overview of types of photos:

- **Macro**: Ideal for detailed close-ups, like insects or toy photography.
- **Portraits**: Perfect for capturing people, whether in street photography or formal portraits.
- **Wildlife**: Best for shooting animals in nature, often requiring a telephoto lens for distant subjects.
- **Landscape**: Great for capturing wide, scenic views like mountains, oceans, or city skylines. Typically, a wide-angle lens works best for these shots to include as much of the scene as possible.

My general advice would be to avoid spending on new gear unless you're feeling limited by the camera you already have with you all the time—your phone. Honestly, some of my most popular photos were taken on my phone, making up about 50% of them. Personally, I care a lot about being able to zoom in and capture every detail because, for me, blur or lack of detail can break the immersion.

But guess what? Many people don’t even mind! As long as you're happy with the results, that's what really matters.

# Quick Tips

- **Noise is your enemy**: Always be mindful of noise in low-light situations. Reducing ISO or using noise reduction software can help mitigate this issue.

## Bad Light

- [YT - Get GREAT PHOTOS in BAD LIGHT!](https://youtu.be/9ro-kLqbhdA?si=GBJln3Av_8ims3AX)
  - Light bouncing from objects is what the camera captures, and it can be tricky in bad lighting conditions.
  - There are three main ways to improve exposure in low-light:
    - **More light into the sensor**: This can be done by slowing down the shutter speed.
      - Use a tripod for stability, especially when capturing static subjects.
      - Use the timer function to prevent camera shake when pressing the shutter.
      - Any movement, either by the photographer or the subject, will result in blur.
    - **Wider apertures**: Open up your aperture to allow more light in (e.g., from f/5.6 to f/2.8).
      - Be aware that this will affect your depth of field, creating a shallow focus.
      - You can use focus stacking in post-processing to keep more of the image sharp.
    - **Light your subject**: Bringing external light sources (flash, reflectors, or portable lighting) can greatly improve photo quality in bad lighting conditions.

# Sony Alpha 6700

The Sony Alpha 6700 is a mirrorless camera that offers many advantages over traditional DSLR cameras:
- **Weight and Size**: Smaller and lighter than DSLRs.
- **Live View**: Real-time exposure and focus through the electronic viewfinder.
- **Faster Shooting**: Improved autofocus and shooting speed.

## Setup

For automatic settings:
- **Auto-menu setup**: The Alpha 6700 has customizable menus where you can assign your most-used functions, speeding up your workflow.
- Limitations: Understanding battery life and overheating in continuous shooting are important considerations for long shoots.

## Lens Nomenclature

- The lens nomenclature for Sony lenses can be tricky. Here's a quick guide:
  - **E-mount**: Sony’s lens mount for APS-C and full-frame cameras.
  - **FE**: Denotes full-frame compatibility.
  - **T***: Zeiss T* coating for improved image quality by reducing reflections.

## Recommended Lenses

    - Excellent performance in low-light situations.
    - Minimum focusing distance of 50 cm.

## Lens Maintenance

Keeping your lens clean is key for sharp photos, and it’s easier than you might think:

1. **Start with a blower**: 
   - Give the lens a good puff of air with a lens blower to get rid of dust. Skip blowing on it with your breath—moisture is the enemy here!

2. **Brush it off**: 
   - If there's still dust, use a soft brush to gently sweep it away. Be careful not to press too hard.

3. **Wipe with microfiber**: 
   - Always use a clean microfiber cloth. Wipe in gentle circles from the center out. No need for pressure—let the cloth do the work.

4. **For smudges, use lens cleaner**: 
   - For fingerprints or greasy spots, dab a bit of lens cleaner onto the cloth (not the lens directly) and gently clean.

5. **Lens wipes work too**: 
   - Pre-moistened lens wipes are a quick and easy option for when you're on the go.

6. **Avoid household cleaners**: 
   - Keep the Windex away! Stick to products made for camera lenses.

7. **If you use a filter**: 
   - Clean your lens filter the same way. It’s easier to replace a scratched filter than a lens.
