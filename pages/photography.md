# Quick Tips

- **Noise is your enemy**: Always be mindful of noise in low-light situations. Reducing ISO or using noise reduction software can help mitigate this issue.

## Bad Light

  - Light bouncing from objects is what the camera captures, and it can be tricky in bad lighting conditions.
  - There are three main ways to improve exposure in low-light:
    - **More light into the sensor**: This can be done by slowing down the shutter speed.
      - Use a tripod for stability, especially when capturing static subjects.
      - Use the timer function to prevent camera shake when pressing the shutter.
      - Any movement, either by the photographer or the subject, will result in blur.
    - **Wider apertures**: Open up your aperture to allow more light in (e.g., from f/5.6 to f/2.8).
      - Be aware that this will affect your depth of field, creating a shallow focus.
      - You can use focus stacking in post-processing to keep more of the image sharp.
    - **Light your subject**: Bringing external light sources (flash, reflectors, or portable lighting) can greatly improve photo quality in bad lighting conditions.

# Sony Alpha 6700

The Sony Alpha 6700 is a mirrorless camera that offers many advantages over traditional DSLR cameras:
- **Weight and Size**: Smaller and lighter than DSLRs.
- **Live View**: Real-time exposure and focus through the electronic viewfinder.
- **Faster Shooting**: Improved autofocus and shooting speed.

## Setup

For automatic settings:
- **Auto-menu setup**: The Alpha 6700 has customizable menus where you can assign your most-used functions, speeding up your workflow.
- Limitations: Understanding battery life and overheating in continuous shooting are important considerations for long shoots.

## Lens Nomenclature

- The lens nomenclature for Sony lenses can be tricky. Here's a quick guide:
  - **E-mount**: Sony’s lens mount for APS-C and full-frame cameras.
  - **FE**: Denotes full-frame compatibility.
  - **T***: Zeiss T* coating for improved image quality by reducing reflections.

## Recommended Lenses

    - Excellent performance in low-light situations.
    - Minimum focusing distance of 50 cm.

## Lens Maintenance

Keeping your lens clean is key for sharp photos, and it’s easier than you might think:

1. **Start with a blower**: 
   - Give the lens a good puff of air with a lens blower to get rid of dust. Skip blowing on it with your breath—moisture is the enemy here!

2. **Brush it off**: 
   - If there's still dust, use a soft brush to gently sweep it away. Be careful not to press too hard.

3. **Wipe with microfiber**: 
   - Always use a clean microfiber cloth. Wipe in gentle circles from the center out. No need for pressure—let the cloth do the work.

4. **For smudges, use lens cleaner**: 
   - For fingerprints or greasy spots, dab a bit of lens cleaner onto the cloth (not the lens directly) and gently clean.

5. **Lens wipes work too**: 
   - Pre-moistened lens wipes are a quick and easy option for when you're on the go.

6. **Avoid household cleaners**: 
   - Keep the Windex away! Stick to products made for camera lenses.

7. **If you use a filter**: 
   - Clean your lens filter the same way. It’s easier to replace a scratched filter than a lens.
